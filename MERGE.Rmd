look in pbp roster and get rid of the cols that have a pff id that isnt na (save those into save1 df) then take those pffs and remove those from pff roster (put those removed ones into save2)

```{r}
# First, split pbp_roster based on pff_id
# save1 will contain rows where pff_id is not NA
save1 <- pbp_roster[!is.na(pbp_roster$pff_id), ]

# Get the remaining pbp_roster rows (where pff_id is NA)
pbp_roster_remaining <- pbp_roster[is.na(pbp_roster$pff_id), ]

# Get the pff_ids that we found in pbp_roster
pff_ids_to_remove <- unique(save1$pff_id)

# Create save2 with the matching rows from pff_roster
save2 <- pff_roster[pff_roster$player_id %in% pff_ids_to_remove, ]

# Remove those rows from pff_roster
pff_roster_remaining <- pff_roster[!pff_roster$player_id %in% pff_ids_to_remove, ]

# Print the dimensions of each resulting dataframe to verify
print("Dimensions of save1 (pbp_roster with pff_ids):")
print(dim(save1))
