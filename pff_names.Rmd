fread the cleaned data
```{r}
library(data.table)
cpff_stats <- fread("cpff_stats.csv.gz")
```

view it via top 1000 cols

```{r}
cpff_1000 <- cpff_stats[1:1000, ]
```

get only the following collums 

year, week, player, position, team_name, player_id using dpylr

```{r}
library(dplyr)
names_pff <- cpff_stats %>% select(year, week, player, position, team_name, player_id)
```


```{r}
# First, let's get unique player-team-year combinations
# This will handle cases where players switch teams, ignoring same-team repeats
player_teams <- names_pff %>%
  distinct(player_id, player, team_name, year) %>%
  group_by(player_id) %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  # Only keep rows where team changes
  mutate(team_changed = team_name != lag(team_name, default = first(team_name))) %>%
  filter(row_number() == 1 | team_changed) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(player_id, year)

# Get earliest and latest years for each player
player_years <- names_pff %>%
  group_by(player_id) %>%
  summarise(
    earliest_year = min(year),
    latest_year = max(year)
  )

# Get most recent position for each player
player_position <- names_pff %>%
  group_by(player_id) %>%
  arrange(desc(year), desc(week)) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  select(player_id, position)

# Get sequential teams for each player (only when team actually changes)
player_team_history <- player_teams %>%
  group_by(player_id) %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  mutate(
    team_sequence = paste0("team", row_number())
  ) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = player_id,
    names_from = team_sequence,

  )

# Get most recent player name
player_names <- names_pff %>%
  group_by(player_id) %>%
  arrange(desc(year), desc(week)) %>%

# Combine all information

  left_join(player_team_history, by = "player_id")

write
